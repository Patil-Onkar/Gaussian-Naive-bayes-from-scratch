# Gaussian-Naive-bayes-from-scratch

The whole purpose of this code is just to understand the Naive bayes algorithm. 

In this code iris flower dataset has been taken and Naive bayes algorithm is applied on this dataset using Numpy and pandas library. At the end we compare our accuracy with the accuracy with scikit library.


**This code is only intended to understand the algorithm
